# ML_for_kirigami_design
Python package to model and to perform topology optimization for graphene kirigami using deep learning.

See our paper 
P. Z. Hanakata, E. D. Cubuk, D. K. Campbell, H.S. Park, Accelerated search and design of stretchable graphene kirigami using machine learning
, arXiv preprint arXiv:1808.06111


This package is still under developement. 

A simple jupyter notebook to perform predictions with scikit-learn package is avalaible in `models/simple/simple_machine_learning.ipynb`
A python code to perform regression with TensorFlow is avalaible in `models/regression_CNN/`


More features (e.g., search algorithm with tensorFlow code) will be added soon.
